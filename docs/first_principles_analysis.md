# Project Analysis Based on First-Principles Thinking


## 1. Problem Definition
Apparent Problem: We need a "Learning Management System" that allows instructors to create courses, upload content (such as videos, PDFs, assignments), and allows students to enroll in these courses, view content, and take exams.

Fundamental Question: "Is the problem truly the lack of a centralized system, or is it the inefficiency in the process of knowledge transfer and learning assessment?"

By shifting the focus from "building a system" to "solving the learning/teaching problem," our perspective fundamentally changes.


## 2. Decomposition of the Problem into First Principles
Principle 1: Knowledge Transfer. One person (the instructor) has information that needs to be transferred to other people (the students).
Principle 2: Content Storage and Access. Educational content (knowledge) must be stored somewhere and be accessible to learners at any time.
Principle 3: Interaction and Q&A. A channel for communication between the instructor and students, and among students themselves, is necessary.


## 3. Rebuilding the Solution from Scratch
Considering the first principles and challenged assumptions, let's rebuild a minimal yet powerful solution from the ground up. Instead of a "Management System," think of a "Learning Facilitation Platform."

Core Structure:
1.  Core: Personal Learning Workspace (instead of a "Course")
 Each student has a personal "workspace."
2.  Learning Unit: "Challenge/Mission" (instead of a "Lesson")
    Each challenge includes a rich set of resources: short videos, articles, links to documentation, code examples, discussion forums.


## 4. Assumptions Checked
Non-linear Learning: Accepted through the "Challenge-based" structure and "resource sets."
Collaborative Learning: Achieved through the "Challenge Discussion Space" and encouragement of collaboration.
Mastery over Completion:The goal is to produce quality output and receive approval, not just pass an exam.


## 5. Conclusion
By breaking down the "Learning Management System" project into its first principles and having the courage to challenge common assumptions (such as linear structure, quantitative assessment, and the instructor-centric model), we arrived at a completely different and potentially more effective solution.
